## *Executive Summary*  
This project leverages Tableau to examine patterns in employee attrition and identify underlying factors influencing workforce turnover. The analysis focuses on job roles, departments, satisfaction levels, gender distribution, and promotion timelines.  
Key findings reveal that *Research & Development and Sales departments experience the highest turnover rates, particularly among roles such as **Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives*. Contributing factors include low job satisfaction, prolonged gaps since promotion, and extended commute distances.  
The dashboard equips HR professionals with actionable insights for reducing attrition by improving career development opportunities, promoting flexible work options, and addressing workload challenges in critical roles.
